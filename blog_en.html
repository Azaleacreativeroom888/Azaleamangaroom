  <h1>Azalea's blog📝</h1>

  <p>Here, I write about my activities related to my creation and my daily observations.</p>

  <h2>Newest</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>2025/07/15:</strong> Oh my...Traslating every single sentence is so much work, so I use AI a little bit. And I fix those sentences that AI made.</li>
    <li><strong>2025/07/15:</strong> 学生時代は「マイナー言語やってたほうが良かったな。英語だとみんな話せるし、マイナー言語同士ですごく仲良さそうだし」って思ってたんだけど、社会人になって「まじで英語やっておいてよかった……」って思うことが多い。就職とか、プログラミングとか、映画とか字幕なしで見る方が感情が伝わるし</li>
    <li><strong>2025/07/14:</strong> このウェブサイトとポッドキャストのフィードバック貰ったらケッコー厳しいこと言われた。そうだよな。最初はなんでも厳しいこと言われるよねと思って頑張る。漫画も最近になってちょっとは肯定的な意見を周りが言ってくれるようになったけど、最初はボロクソに言われたし。でもウェブサイトはあんまり凝りすぎとローディングが長くなってしまうから、どうしたもんか</li>
    <li><strong>2025/07/13:</strong> 仮面ライダーアギトがめっちゃ面白い。中盤で一気にミステリー要素強くなった</li>
    <li><strong>2025/07/13:</strong> ポケモンサンムーンクリアした。四天王クリアできなくてネットで見たオススメのポケモンをひたすらレベル上げしてて、そのポケモンたちが55レベルになったから「そろそろ勝てるかな」と思って挑んだら、ジュナイパーとソルガレオが強くなりすぎてその二体で倒せた(笑)</li>
    <li><strong>2025/07/12:</strong> プログラミング面白い……面白いけど難しい。ウェブサイト作るのは割と簡単だったのに、スケジュール帳アプリを作るのが大変。これでスケジュール帳を作れたらいろいろと楽になるはず。まあ、でもメインは漫画制作だからね。とりあえず早くblenderで剣作らなきゃ</li>
    <li><strong>2025/07/11:</strong> 激弱勇者の線画とだいたいの仕上げが終わったんだけど、登場人物の使う道具をblenderで作ってみたくて一から勉強してるので、２話の完成に時間がかかってる</li>
    <li><strong>2025/07/11:</strong> I read Kazuhiko Torishima(editor of Dragon Ball)'s book, and it was interesting. The story behind the golden age of Jump(shonen magazine) is spoke openly in this book, and I thought how he is being honest with the fans was amazing.</li>
    <li><strong>2025/07/11:</strong> I can't enjoy pure literature anymore. Recently, I have been focusing exclusively on science fiction, mystery, foreign fantasy, and new books. I probably couldn't read it anymore after I had a job. When I was a student, I was moved by the detailed depictions of people's feelings on literature. Well, that's not a problem, I'm just curious why I cannot read pure literature anymore. I wanted to read "Why can't I read books when I'm working(Japanese Non-fiction book)?"</li>
    <li><strong>2025/07/10:</strong> I've added a counter to this blog where how many visitors come by to my homepage, but I'm wondering if my mental health is okay...... I'm just getting started, so take it easy...... Take it easy</li>
    <li><strong>2025/07/10:</strong> I see the pros and cons on AI, but it was difficult for me to explain to my art teacher why people who dislike AI illustrations are against it. It's amazing how well people can explain how they feel. The fact that this kind of debate occurs is bacause this is in the early era of AI.</li>
    <li><strong>2025/07/10:</strong> Some English "specialist" who I find on YouTube, his speaking skills are poor and his background is a bit suspicious. After all, don't be fooled by qualifications. What's important is speaking to English speakers, watching movies without subtitles, posting something in Enlglish on social media, reading foreign books. I think simple things like that can improve your English skills. Qualifications are only for reference, and it is dangerous to judge people by their titles.</li>
    <li><strong>2025/07/06:</strong> Kamen Rider Kuuga(Hero TV show) exhibition was held. I personally liked the Vilain section</li>
    <li><strong>2025/07/04:</strong> I'm studying something I want to do with Blender(CAD application) and programming to help drawing a manga, but it's so difficult. But compared to programming, I understand Blender better</li>
    <li><strong>2025/07/03:</strong> I've had a lot of complaints about the calendar app, so I'm grateful that ChatGPT can create a calendar app from scratch. However, even through I use AI for a lot in a supplementary but why do I feel so reluctant to do from 0 to 100 to AI to draw my manga?</li>
    <li><strong>2025/07/02:</strong> It's so hard to tell people what I like or not. Just because I don't like something doesn't mean I want others to hate it. I know that I am the only one that I don't like it, but when I say "I don't like them," some people turn hostile at me. I'm not denying their preferences, I think everyone has their own likes and dislikes......</li>
    <li><strong>2025/07/01:</strong> I don't care about celebrity gossip, and I want a little more useful information these days</li>
    <li><strong>2025/06/30:</strong> I listened to Kazuhiko Torishima(editor of Dragon Ball)'s radio station kosokoso Hosokyoku. It was great.</li>
    <li><strong>2025/06/29:</strong> I got COVID......my throat herts</li>
    <li><strong>2025/06/27:</strong> Website opened!</li>
    <li><strong>2025/06/26:</strong> I went to Konica Minolta's planetarium. The stars were beautiful, the music was pleasant, and I almost fell asleep. After that, I went to Tetsuko Kuroyanagi's special exhibition called "Glam". All those dresses were so glittering and flashy.</li>
    <li><strong>2025/06/24:</strong> I went to Hakodate(North part of Japan) for 3 days and 2 nights! I wanted one more day, but I was able to see around every places that my husband and I wanted to go just in a hurry. It's a pity that I couldn't see the night view from Mt. Hakodate due to fog, but I'm generally satisfied</li>
    <li><strong>2025/06/20:</strong> I'm drawing the second episode of a new manga.</li>
